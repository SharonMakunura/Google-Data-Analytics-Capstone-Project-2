# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-2
Optional completion in partial fulfillment of Google Data Analytics certification.

I completed this project just to keep practising what I learnt.  This one is from the first track using existing data to answer set questions.

The repository contains the following files:  which contains excerpts of SQL scripts used for data cleaning and initial analysis; which contain the analysis in R programming code;  which is a read-only PowerPoint file that summarized the findings; and Excel sumamry files.rar which contains summary files compiled from the analysis process.
