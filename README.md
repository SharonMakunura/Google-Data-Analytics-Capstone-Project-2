# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-2
Optional completion in partial fulfillment of Google Data Analytics certification.

I completed this project just to keep practising what I learnt.  This one is from the first track using existing data to answer set questions.

The repository contains the following files: bellabeat-sql-script.txt which contains excerpts of SQL scripts used for data cleaning and initial analysis; bellabeat-sql-script.R which contains the analysis in R programming code;  ellabeat-documentation.Rmd, an RMarkdown file documenting the entire analysis process; and data-cleaning-log.rar which contains an Excel log of the data cleaning process.  

A slideshow summarizing the results can be viewed at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQUS_1eaDwoC8EYTEy7TbU1NPwUlldVEqQQhdq3AGdicFNvBUPMrfdXPzykxQP7IyVREaSYVnYh86K2/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000.
